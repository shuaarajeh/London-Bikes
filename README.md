# London Bike

In this project, I used the London Bikes dataset from Kaggle [London Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset). I manipulated the dataset regarding labeling and code meaning to make it clearer when visualizing.

The refined version of the dataset was then used in Tableau to create a simple dashboard. The Tableau dashboard can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/London-BikesDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
